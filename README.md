Explain why you need WAN connectivity for your network. Is it because you need to connect geographically dispersed branches and clients? Do you need WAN connectivity to an Internet service provider?

What are some of the WAN options that are possible for your network? Explain what will be your choice for WAN services? Find out examples of some of the WAN service providers who can provide the required WAN service for your network.

2.Role of the Internet

Explain the role of Internet in your network? If you choose to use private WAN service instead of the public Internet for your service, explain about your decision to do so. Explain the pros and cons of using Internet to send and receive business and client data.
